                <h4>Our Mission</h4>
                <p>The I DID application is all about helping you reach your goals. Whatever that goal may be. These are some testimonials from others who have used our applicataion. Our aim is to foster a sense of achievement in you. Think of good things you have done today towards your goal. By reflecting on the positives in our day this motivates us to continue striving towards our goals. As you reflect on all the tasks you managed to accomplish for the day you realise how much you actually accomplished. Too often we are so consumed in our lives to reflect on our achievements so they go unrecognised and we feel stagnated. This application is to show you the true value of your efforts. All achievements no matter how big or small deserve to be noted and celebrated. You can achieve your goal one task at a time.</p>

            <!--Perfection! One problem however that can occur is if your paragraphs vary in length, you could have one paragraph entering the space of another- thus they will not align perfectly. It is very easy to fix this problem all you have to do is throw a div before the problem column which jumped up states <div class="clearfix visible-sm"> visible-sm kind of means this clear fix will only occur on the problem screen being small screens. As an example I will make a few unever paragraphs and fix it-->
